# Raspberry-Pi-Security-System

The code for a security system I made by using a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino, a Pi Camera, a reed switch, an RFID reader, and a servo.
It monitors my room and records video if an intruder is detected.

- The Arduino is connected to the Raspberry Pi via a USB hub; it sends a serial message when the door is opened while the system is activated.

- A PHP webpage displays the latest video taken when an intruder has been detected.

[Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) is needed to view the schematic file
